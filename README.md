## Getting-Started-in-Electronics

A guide to get you started in electronics. There are quite a few resources online, such as sites, guides, channels, etc, but in the abyss of all that information it can be daunting for the beginner like myself. What tools do I really need vs what can wait, what components do I need, what are some good books, what are some good projects to start with? Are all questions I once had, some I still don't know the answer. In this repository, I plan to collect ideas, processes, and just share it with the world as my family, and myself learn electronics, Welcome to the World of Famtronics!

## Discord Community

I am part of a few large communities in other realms, and I quite like the way discord handles communication. It is real time communication, unlike email or forums. You can have good organization of channels. More importantly tons of people use it. So on your spare time, you can help others in the community with answering questions and sharing your knowledge.
