# Equipment

Equipment is one of the areas where I think there is so much information or misinformation online, biased personal opinions, etc. So I am making this guide for two main branches, breadboard or solder projects. Breadboarding prototypes is quicker than soldering projects. I also think is better to breadboard projects in the beginning so you can reuse components. From these two main branches, I am marking items as definitely needed, or can wait for later.

Not sure if I can cater to all types of budgets, but I will try my best to add budget choices where possible. These are mere suggestions, feel free to shop around.

> NB: These are only suggestions, as always safety is paramount. When dealing with AC and even DC at high voltages it can result in death. Always look at the safety features of what you buy. I take no responsability in your choices. Most of these items can be found on ebay or elsewhere, but it is nice to see reviews on items on Amazon to get an idea if the item is worth it.

## Test Equipment

- Digital multimeter (DN).
For a good multimeter you want to spend anywhere from $40 to $200 there are cheaper but I wouldn't recomment going to cheap. The prices here range all over the place due to features, safety ratings, etc. At minimum get a meter that reads AC/DC voltage, Current, and Resistance. If you can find one for a decent price with CATIII and autorange get it. Fluke is the obvious choice, but if you're going to be dealing with low voltage, you can go for a lower end meter. Also always consult your meter manual and get spare fuses for when things don't go accordingly.
