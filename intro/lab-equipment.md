# Equipment

Equipment is one of the areas where I think there is so much misinformation online. So I am making this guide for two main branches breadboard or solder projects. Breadboarding prototypes is quicker, and I think is better to breadboard projects in the beginning so you can reuse components. From these two main branches, I am marking items as definitely needed, or can wait for later. Lastly I am categorizing into maybe 3 different budgets.

- Digital multimeter
- Oscilloscope?
- Logic analyzer?
- Power supply
- Function generator
- Soldering iron
- Soldering iron tips
- Solder lead, lead free
- Solder flux
- Solder tip cleaner
- Solder wick
- Set of tweezers
- Side cutters flush
- Set of pliers
- Solder smoke absorber?
- Surface mount magnification
- USB Microscope
- Hot glue gun
- Hot work gun
- Hook up wire kit
