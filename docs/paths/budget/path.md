# budget-path

In this path I chose the 200 projects Electronics Learning Lab Kit from RadioShack Part No. 2800055. As you might already know RadioShack or Tandy went out of business. You can find the used kit from people selling it online, mine was manufactured in 2014, and got near brand new conditions.

This kit was recommended to me by another electronics enthusiast for a few reasons. It contains everything you need the main board has built-in components, breadboard, power rails, easy spring connectors. More importantly it has two books with practical theory and exercises by Forrest Mims III.

## TODO

- Add components list link

## Word of caution

This is how I will follow my path, and adjust as I go, feel free to make your own path if you're not a complete beginner like me.

## Workbook 1 (Estimated learning time 3-6 months)
