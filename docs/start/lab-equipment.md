# Equipment

Equipment is one of the areas where I think there is so much information or misinformation online, biased personal opinions, etc. So I am making this guide for two main branches, breadboard or solder projects. Breadboarding prototypes is quicker than soldering projects. I also think is better to breadboard projects in the beginning so you can reuse components. From these two main branches, I am marking items as definitely needed, or can wait for later.

I'd suggest to start with breadboarding, and after you feel comfortable you'd probably want to start making some of those projects into pcb's or perf boards which would require soldering.

Not sure if I can cater to all types of budgets, but I will try my best to add budget choices where possible. These are mere suggestions, feel free to shop around. I'd try to put links to the highest reviewed items as well. For most of these items, there is usually a cheaper alternative on ebay, but just be very careful, sometimes cheap means you'll have to buy two or three of the same item. Also a word of advice, most of the time cheaper means lower quality, but in the beginning stage sometimes you can make that sacrifice in order to get started. As you progress you start to get a good feeling of what you need to upgrade to a better quality.


> NB: These are only suggestions, as always safety is paramount. When dealing with AC and even DC at high voltages it can result in death. Always look at the safety features of what you buy. I take no responsability in your choices. Most of these items can be found on ebay or elsewhere, but it is nice to see reviews on items on Amazon to get an idea if the item is worth it.

## Test Equipment

- Digital multimeter X2(DN).
For a good multimeter you want to spend anywhere from $40 to $200 there are cheaper but I wouldn't recomment going to cheap. The prices here range all over the place due to features, safety ratings, etc. At minimum get a meter that reads AC/DC voltage, Current, and Resistance. If you can find one for a decent price with CATIII and autorange get it. Fluke is the obvious choice, but if you're going to be dealing with low voltage, you can go for a lower end meter. Also always consult your meter manual and get spare fuses for when things don't go accordingly. Get two if you can afford it.

- Oscilloscope (CW).
When it comes to oscilloscope, there are so many options out there. Tektronix, Rigol, Siglent, Owon, Hantek, etc. You have digital, analog, pocket size, usb, and more. In addition to the options, the prices range from a couple hundred dollars up to thousands. Which ever you pick, make sure to watch several youtube reviews, this is a big purchase item, and one that should last a few years.

    - Other options is to look on craiglist, ebay, yard sales, pawn shops, any place where you can shop around for used equipment.
    - ebay has a wide variety of used analog oscilloscopes as well.

- Logic analyzer (CW).
Good logic analyzers can run quite expensive, there are a few clones out there which I don't recommend but if you're short on money do what you have to do. The good thing is that not everyone needs them.
