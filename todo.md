A good idea would be to learn ac/dc theory, ohm's law. Build building blocks circuits, and then build all your own test equipment. The idea of building everything from scratch might not appeal to everyone though, so not sure. But it would definitely make for a great learning experience and also you can build something great and cheaper. You can also mod and upgrade software as you know everything about the project.
